"""Lay out a multi-level flowchart and draw it as inline SVG.

The CSS renderer in ``diagrams.py`` covers a single chain and a one-level fan.
Anything wider — a supply chain running suppliers → company → buyers over
several levels — has no sensible flex-box form: it degrades to one row per edge,
repeating the hub's name on every line.

SVG is the way out. WeasyPrint draws inline SVG properly (rounded boxes, fills,
elbowed connectors, arrowheads), so a real diagram reaches the PDF without
pulling Node and a headless browser into the project just to run mermaid.

What this does is the classic layered-graph recipe: assign each node a level,
order the nodes inside each level to keep connectors from crossing, place them,
then route orthogonal edges. It is not a general graph drawer — it assumes the
graph flows in one direction, which is what the report templates produce.
